# CS4624 - Food Safety Website

This is the repository for the CS4624 Food Safety Website Capstone Team. This README serves as a descriptor for project specifications.

## Project Description
We would like to design and develop a website that will be used by farmers market growers and vendors who do not fall under the Produce Safety Rule or Preventive Controls for Human Food Rule due to their farm size and annual revenue. We hope this mobile-friendly, easily interfaceable website can provide quick and pertinent information to these individuals. We would like for the information that a farmer can potentially get to be customizable and unique to that farmer. For example, if a farmer grows tomatoes on a farm and also has livestock (cows, chickens), this farmer can add or distinguish these characteristics into a form or part of the website and be given answers and resources depending on what keywords they have in their question.

## Team Members

## Project Deliverables
* A website designed for farmers market growers and vendors to get information
* Goal of website: Provide information at quick response rate for farmers, that is customizable depending on a farm's characteristics (products a farm grows or produces; products they are processing or value-adding to, farm size)
* A website with a repository that is mobile-friendly and easy to interface with
* A way to add particular elements or characteristics of a farm to provide tailored information.
  * EX: Farmer John, growing tomatoes and lettuce, has a farm of 2,500 square acres, processes his tomatoes into salsa, has farm animals, and uses well water.
* Developing opt-in services (text/email alerts) that provide reminders and new resource alerts depending on a farm's characteristics as well as provide a way for Extension agents or food safety Virginia Tech faculty to connect with these folks to do Extension work, which will act as an engagement system.
* Future use: It would be great to one day be able to utilize this website for other food safety information outside of the Produce Safety Rule and Preventive Controls for Human Food Rule
  * Expected impact of the project: This website would be linked to the Virginia Cooperative Extension webpage and used as a resource for extension agents, and farmers market vendors to inform them about key food safety issues. This would be the first website of this type to assist small farmers selling foods in local markets.
  * Required skills of the team engaging in the project: Website, Database
  * URLs to follow for additional information:
    * [Produce Safety Rule FAQ](https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/pdf/producesfty-FAQsheet.pdf)
    * [Is my farm operation covered or exempt from the Produce Safety Rule?](https://vce.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_emnhR0UpFpiVvlr)
    * [Example of input-output wanted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B5x3GjGn8z2aktwJnz_q_3ugCFXgf_6QPZ-gyFmA5jM/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Type of project (digital library, digital preservation activity, video, construction effort in Second Life, game, web site, database, …): Website, Database


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
